Clustering using K Means, Fuzzy C Means and Gaussian Mixture Model

This repository contains implementations of K Means Clustering , Fuzzy C Means Clustering and Guassian Mixture Model.
These methods have been applied on 500 data points drawn from each of 3 (three) Gaussians: N1 (1, 0.1), N2 (1.5., 0.1) and N3 (2, 0.2)
Later these methods have been compared in the Report
